## Contributing

This contribution guide is temporary and may evolve to match Qubic requirements
once v1 of the protocol Bridge is deployed.

### Before You Open a PR
- Open an issue and discuss the change before sending a pull request.
- Use a non-main branch for ongoing work.
- Attempt to follow the prevailing code style and patterns in the repo.

### Pull Request Requirements
- Every PR must include unit tests and achieve 100% code coverage.
- All integrated CI services must be green before a PR can be merged.
- At least one representative of Avicenne must approve the PR before merging.
- If consensus cannot be reached, Avicenne makes the final decision.

### Git Hygiene
- No `--force` pushes on `main`.
- Do not modify Git history in any way after a PR has been merged.
