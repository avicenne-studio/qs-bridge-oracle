## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it **privately** using GitHub’s built-in reporting tool.

1. Go to the repository’s main page  
2. Click **"Security" -> "Report a vulnerability"**

This creates a **private** report that is visible only to the maintainers.  
A coordinated disclosure workflow will begin once the issue is triaged.

We review all reports and will respond as quickly as possible.
